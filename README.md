# Introduction
This is a small and lightweight c++ template library for matrix algebra.

It provides simple matrix operations, linear solvers(LU, QR), eigen solvers(power method, QR algorithm) and some algorithms based on these, like inverse, null space and determinates.

Please note that this library is not inteded to be used for any high performance matrix algorithms. This is simply the design goal of this library as all matrices are returned on the stack(!). It is inteded to be used as a small helper library (originally for CUDA algorithms) when developing algorithms.

# Installation
There should be nothing to do besides including the appropriate files.

# Bugs
- The `hessenbergReduction`function is not working correctly.
- The `svd` function is not working correctly.
